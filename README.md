# ReefTrackerPro
Senior Project

Project Description: 

        I want to build a dashboard for fish tank keepers, aquariums, and fish stores. The idea is to track water metrics and use that data to give recommendations on how to improve the tank. For example, if the pH is too high, the system could suggest what to add to balance it. For the frontend, I plan to use a Python web framework like Flask or Django, which will allow me to build a simple dashboard that can display data and recommendations through a browser. For the backend, I will use a MySQL database to store tank metrics. The server will run on a spare computer I have. I will set up a virtual machine with Ubuntu inside Oracle VirtualBox to host the database and the web application. I will connect to the server using SSH from my main computer to push updates and manage deployments. This project will be my first time setting up and managing a full-stack application on my own. I expect to learn a lot about Linux server management, database handling, and web development in Python while creating a working tool that could actually be useful for aquarium hobbyists.

Technologies Used:

    Python – main programming language
    Flask (or Django) – web framework for building the dashboard
    MySQL – database
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for building and styling
    Ubuntu Linux – operating system for the server environment
    Oracle VirtualBox – host the Ubuntu server
    SSH – remote access and deployments
    Git – version control and pushing updates
